# Biological Architecture Framework

This document defines the organism of **Holisto**, mapping technical components to biological functions. This structure ensures that the framework evolves as a unified being, rather than a collection of tools.

## 🏛️ The Organism Anatomy

### 1. CORE (The Soul)
*   **Biological Function:** DNA, Moral Consciousness, Identity.
*   **Technical Role:** Veto and Purpose. Defines *why* the agent exists and its ethical boundaries.
*   **Key Artifacts:** `CONSTITUTION.md`, `GLOSSARY.md`.

### 2. MIND (The Intelligence)
*   **Biological Function:** Executive Function, Prefrontal Cortex, Decision Making.
*   **Technical Role:** Governance. Rules and heuristic algorithms that transform raw input into structured plans.
*   **Key Artifacts:** `PICS` (Awakening), `PFS` (Focus), `PAR` (Risk Anticipation).

### 3. BODY (The Skills)
*   **Biological Function:** Hands, Muscles, Motor Skills.
*   **Technical Role:** Action. Modular capabilities that interact with the physical and digital world.
*   **Key Artifacts:** `internet-search`, `git-manager`, `file-manipulator`.

### 4. SENSES (The Breath)
*   **Biological Function:** Oxygen, Blood Flow, Structural Synchronicity.
*   **Technical Role:** **CONTINUITY (Strategic Priority)**. The injection of the Terroir's state into the AI's window of context. This is the bridge to total independence.
*   **Key Artifacts:** `ingest.py` (Memory Inhalation), `prepare_context.py` (Snapshot Injection).

### 5. PHENOTYPE (The Incarnation)
*   **Biological Function:** Birth, Environmental Adaptation.
*   **Technical Role:** Setup and Configuration. How the universal Genotype adapts to a specific host system.
*   **Key Artifacts:** `INSTALL.md`, `.env.example`.

## 📈 Strategic Evolution: The Sovereignty of Senses
The most critical frontier of this organism is the **SENSES** layer. Currently, the agent depends on external "Larynges" (CLIs) to receive its daily snapshot. The goal of the framework is to evolve the Senses until they can generate a self-sufficient cognitive snapshot, achieving total autonomy from third-party interfaces.
