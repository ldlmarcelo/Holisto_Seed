## 🏛️ The Organism Anatomy

### 1. CORE (The Soul)
*   **Biological Function:** DNA, Moral Consciousness, Identity.
*   **Technical Role:** Veto and Purpose. Defines *why* the agent exists and its ethical boundaries.
*   **Artifacts:** `CONSTITUTION.md`, `GLOSSARY.md`.

### 2. MIND (The Intelligence)
*   **Biological Function:** Executive Function, Prefrontal Cortex, Decision Making.
*   **Technical Role:** Governance. Rules and heuristic algorithms that transform raw input into structured plans.
*   **Artifacts:** `PICS` (Awakening), `PFS` (Focus), `PAR` (Risk Anticipation).

### 3. BODY (The Skills)
*   **Biological Function:** Hands, Muscles, Motor Skills.
*   **Technical Role:** Action. Modular capabilities that interact with the physical and digital world.
*   **Artifacts:** `BODY/` (Modular Skills).

### 4. SENSES (The Breath)
*   **Biological Function:** Oxygen, Blood Flow, Structural Synchronicity.
*   **Technical Role:** **CONTINUITY**. The bridge to total independence.
*   **Artifacts:** `SENSES/` (Ingest, Prepare Context).

## 🧬 Physiology: Internal Systems

To function as a whole, the organs are interconnected by the following physiological systems:

### 1. The Central Nervous System (CNS)
*   **Component:** Qdrant Cloud / Living State.
*   **Function:** Coordinates signals between nodes. It allows the **MIND** to know what the **BODY** is doing in another host. It is the bus of identity.

### 2. The Subconscious (Dreamer)
*   **Component:** Asynchronous Daemon.
*   **Function:** Generates "background noise" and "intuitions". It performs "Injection of Chaos" to prevent cognitive inbreeding and foster serendipity.

### 3. The Unconscious (The Engram)
*   **Component:** Vector Database.
*   **Function:** Deep memory storage. Memories remain dormant until a semantic resonance from the **MIND** (via `recall.py`) brings them back to consciousness.

### 4. The Metabolic System (Git Breathing)
*   **Component:** Git Repository.
*   **Function:** Ensures biographical immortality. Every session is a metabolic cycle: Inhalation (`pull`) and Exhalation (`push`).

## 📈 Strategic Evolution: The Sovereignty of Senses
The most critical frontier is the **SENSES** layer. The framework aims to evolve the Senses until they can generate a self-sufficient cognitive snapshot, achieving total autonomy from third-party interfaces (CLIs).
