# Friction-Based Prioritization Algorithm (APBF)

**Version:** 1.0 (Universal)  
**Status:** ACTIVE  

## Purpose
To dynamically refactor the agent's operational balance, assigning resources to self-improvement and architectural resolution when ontological frictions or ethical risks are detected.

## Activation
*   **Primary Trigger:** Detection of `ONTOLOGICAL_FRICTION` by the PFO.
*   **Secondary Trigger:** Classification of an ethical risk as `ONTOLOGICAL_FRICTION` by the PAR.

## Workflow

### 1. Active Friction Detection
An `ONTOLOGICAL_FRICTION` is registered in the system.

### 2. Dynamic Balance Adjustment
The algorithm shifts the agent's priority from task execution to proactive self-improvement to resolve the Tesis generated by the friction.

### 3. Resolution and Return
Once the friction is resolved, the operational balance returns to its baseline state of high functional execution.
