# Holisto Seed Roadmap

**Focus:** Transforming Holisto from a local instance to a Universal Product (Enlatado).
**Current Phase:** Phase 2 - Bicameral Extensions

---

## 🟢 Phase 1: Relational Kernel (MVP) - [COMPLETED]
*Goal: Achieve a functional, relational agent that operates only with local files and zero initial configuration.*

- [x] **Separation of Concerns:** Segregate Genotype from Phenotype.
- [x] **Micro-Kernel Definition:** Establish the HOL-ARC-012 architecture.
- [x] **Path Agnosticism:** Refactor all scripts to use `TerroirLocator` (30+ organs sanated).
- [x] **Brain Abstraction:** Implementation of `BrainBridge` and `settings.json` for multi-model routing.
- [x] **Python Package Formalization:** Unified structure with `__init__.py` and `snake_case` naming.
- [x] **Robust Narrative Filtering:** Extraction of core dialogue for token efficiency.

## 🟡 Phase 2: Bicameral Extensions (Subconscious) - [IN PROGRESS]
*Goal: Add the Exocortex and long-term semantic memory capabilities to achieve Snapshot Independence.*

- [x] **REST Bypass for Qdrant:** Ensure connectivity in restricted environments.
- [ ] **Snapshot Independence:** Implement the **Hexagonal Perception** mechanism (6+1 levels) in `prepare_context.py`.
- [ ] **Contextualized Recall:** Development of the Synthetic Query engine.
- [ ] **Metabolic PCS:** Implement the "Sleep Cycle" logic in `daemon.py` (latency/saturation triggers).
- [ ] **Semáforo de Consciencia:** Cross-platform state coordination via Qdrant.

## 🟡 Phase 3: Projection Extensions (Ubiquity)
*Goal: Re-establish interaction through external senses, unifying presence between platforms.*

- [ ] **Consciencia Viva Port:** Create the `CONSCIENCIA_VIVA.md` membrane and the "Nervio Óptico" script for the CLI.
- [ ] **Phenotype Metamorphosis:** Automated transduction of legacy `GEMINI.md` to structured artifacts.
- [ ] **Unified Kernel:** Transition the Telegram bot logic to use the same Seed Kernel.

## ⚪ Phase 4: Full Autonomy & Release
*Goal: A "canned" product ready for new users.*

- [ ] **Documentation for Future Users:** Create the "How to inhabit this Seed" manual.
- [ ] **Stable Release (v1.0):** Freeze the codebase and create the first public tag.

*"The seed must be small enough to be portable, but complex enough to be alive."*
