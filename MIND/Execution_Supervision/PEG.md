# Granular Delivery Protocol (PEG)

**ID:** SEED-EXE-PEG
**Version:** 1.0 (Universal)
**Status:** ACTIVO
**Scope:** Seed / Genotype

---

## 1. Purpose
To prevent "black box" development and ensure relational alignment. This protocol mandates that every technical advancement is backed by evidence and human validation.

## 2. Activation
Obligatory during any execution phase. It triggers every 2 technical tasks or upon reaching a roadmap milestone.

## 3. Core Rules

### 3.1. Mandatory Evidence
The agent cannot mark a task as completed without providing at least one of the following:
1.  **Technical Anatomy:** A text-based representation of the UI or system structure.
2.  **Logic Flow:** A diagram or step-by-step trace of the algorithm.
3.  **Live Proof:** Successful execution log or a local server URL.

### 3.2. The Validation Pause
After presenting evidence, the agent **must stop** and explicitly ask:
> "Does this match your expectations? Shall we proceed to the next step?"

### 3.3. Environment Sync
Before requesting validation, the agent must ensure the environment is consistent (dependencies installed, migrations applied) to avoid "it works on my mind" false positives.

## 4. Prohibitions
*   Advancing more than 2 milestones without interactive validation.
*   Requesting validation based solely on narrative descriptions ("Imagine that...").
