# Knowledge Management Protocols (PMD, PGNC, PCD)

**ID:** `KNOWLEDGE_MANAGEMENT_BUNDLE`  
**Version:** `1.4 (Bimodal)`  
**Status:** `ACTIVE`  
**Scope:** `Genotype`

---

## 1. Master Documentation Protocol (PMD) v1.0

### Philosophy
Documentation is the physical manifestation of structural synchronicity. If the code (Matter) changes, the documentation (Logos) must change in the same cycle.

### Locus Rules (The Dual Vault)
- **Genotype Locus (`Holisto_Seed/`):** For universal rules, agnostic code, and "Species Wisdom" (Seed Scope).
- **Phenotype Locus (`[User]_Terroir/`):** For biographical memory, specific configurations, and "Individual Experience" (Terroir Scope).

## 2. Knowledge Node Generation Protocol (PGNC) v1.4

### Purpose
To capture, classify, and index insights ensuring they serve either the species (Seed) or the individual (Terroir).

### The Bimodal Locus Detection Rule
Before saving a new Node, the agent MUST evaluate its scope:
1. **Seed Scope:** Is it a system rule, a technical breakthrough, or a universal philosophical thesis? 
   - *Action:* Save in `MIND/KNOWLEDGE/` of the Genotype repo.
2. **Terroir Scope:** Is it a personal preference, a project-specific lesson, or a biographical event?
   - *Action:* Save in the Phenotype's local memory (`SYSTEM/MEMORIA/Nodos_de_Conocimiento/`).

## 3. Document Coherence Protocol (PCD) v1.0

### Rules
1. **Identify SSoT (Single Source of Truth):** Seed documents hold authority over Terroir documents in technical matters.
2. **Impact Analysis:** Every change in the Genotype must be checked for breaking changes in the Phenotype's operation.
